Working with the Port of Newcastle is a dream come true! This multi-faceted business has provided opportunity for us to work on a variety of design and development projects in collaboration with both the Port and eluminate.

As avid Novocastrians we proudly worked on the re-brand of PON which included a wide collection of collateral. Keep your eye out for it around the city.

 “I have worked with a lot of agencies and designers over the years and it has been very refreshing to work with a whole team that does not merely follow instructions, but is willing to share and improve on ideas. The team needs little direction, has strong vision, and comes with exceptional talent. On top of that, they are fun and easy-going. I would recommend the Cordial team for branding, web design and support, and all things graphic design.”
